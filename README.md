# Ultimate-BashRC

This repository has been created so I can add all what appears to me the best commands, aliases, functions to a BashRC file. This file is probably one of the most used bash file. Therefore, I'll use it and modify it to my needs.

Please do not attempt a clone right now and expect everything to work as intended as everything may be build up only for my personal computer. However, my goal is to make this BashRC file easily customizable so everybody can use it and adapt it t their need.
